  "Description": "This dataset description pertains to the conceptual framework of the EEGFlow project. No real data is included yet. The project aims to collect multimodal neuroimaging data (HD-EEG, fMRI, MRI) to validate theories of consciousness and develop technologies for mind uploading. The repository includes placeholder scripts demonstrating the intended BIDS-compliant analysis pipeline, from preprocessing to source imaging and causal modeling."
