    "abstract": "Thief of Truth is a first-person perspective Virtual Reality (VR) comic that explores the relationship between humans and artificial intelligence (AI). The work tells the story of a mind-uploaded human being reborn as a new subject while interacting with an AI that is looking for the meaning of life. In order to experiment with the expandability of VR comics, the work was produced by focusing on three problems. First, the comic is designed using the viewing control effect of VR. Second, through VR controller-based interaction, the player's immersion in the work is increased. Third, a method for increasing accessibility to VR comics was devised. This work aims to present an example of an experimental attempt in VR Comics.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has become widespread in recent times for various aspects  , including medical aspects. Some of which aims to extend human life and delay the signs of aging. The research problem of this study lies in clarifying the perspective of Islamic jurisprudence on the intervention of technology in the human body. The objectives of this research is to discuss the technological interventions aimed at extending human life and delaying the signs of aging, and to explore the jurisprudential ruling. The research adopted a descriptive and deductive research approach to obtain the research objectives. Regarding technological interventions aimed at prolonging human life and delaying the signs of aging, the study divided these interventions into three approaches. The first is the biological method that is based on advances in genetics and biotechnology and focuses on enhancing the immune system genetically. The study concluded that such method is impermissible. The second method is the electronic method which is based on advances in nanotechnology and robotics, and focuses on various parts of the body with artificial substitutes, such as artificial skin. The study found that the ruling on such method varies depending on the situation. As such, replacing damaged human body parts with prosthetic limbs is regarded permissible since it falls under the type of medical treatment. Moreover, regarding the technological interventions to enhance human capabilities, it is found that an in-depth study is required to explore such an issue. The third method is the virtual method known as mind uploading  which involves digitizing the information contained in the brain -such as memories, and information- and then transferring it to a machine. From the perspective of Islamic jurisprudence, this method is considered permissible; however, it must not cause any harm to the brain.",

    "title": "The multiplicity objection against uploading optimism",
    "abstract": "Abstract\n          Could we transfer you from your biological substrate to an electronic hardware by simulating your brain on a computer? The answer to this question divides optimists and pessimists about mind uploading. Optimists believe that you can genuinely survive the transition; pessimists think that surviving mind uploading is impossible. An influential argument against uploading optimism is the multiplicity objection. In a nutshell, the objection is as follows: If uploading optimism were true, it should be possible to create not only one, but multiple digital versions of you. However, you cannot literally become many. Hence, you cannot survive even a single instance of uploading, and optimism about uploading is misguided. In this paper, I will first spell out the multiplicity objection in detail and then provide a two-pronged defence against the objection. First, uploading pessimists cannot establish that uploading optimism has the contentious implication. Second, it is in fact plausible to think that we could become multiple distinct persons. Optimists’ hope for a digital afterlife is therefore not thwarted by the prospect of multiplicity.",

    "title": "‘Through Valley of the Shadow of Death’: Death In-Between and Betwixt “Life After Life” in Mind Uploading Immortality",
    "abstract": "This article engages the concept of death as a revolutionary transformation within the contexts of mind uploading (MU) and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin’s theology of the Omega Point. The focus is not on the Omega Point itself as a conceptual endpoint, nor on what becomes of consciousness once it has been successfully uploaded into a digital substrate. To grasp the meaning of “death” within the context of MU, the article employs the notion of liminal speculative imagination to analyze death amid the liminality of biological mortality and digital immortality. It argues that death is more than just the end of life but rather as a transitional phase between different states of being. It contends that this liminal gap between life forms is an inherent aspect of existence that cannot be eliminated at a fundamental level. Instead of seeking to overcome death, the article suggests embracing the transformative nature of this liminality. In this view, death is seen as a natural and unavoidable part of life, serving as a mediator or catalyst for transitions into new forms of existence. Rather than focusing solely on achieving immortality, the article advocates for utilizing technology to facilitate evolution and advancement. By acknowledging the role of death in the process of transformation, particularly within the context of transhumanism, the article proposes that embracing liminality can lead to new possibilities for human evolution. This includes the potential emergence of transhuman life forms, such as those enabled by MU technologies.",

    "abstract": "Optimists about mind-uploading believe that we can survive uploading. Pessimists about mind-uploading, on the other hand, believe that we cannot survive uploading. An under-explored middle ground between the two is a selective form of optimism, which claims that we can survive some\n forms of uploading, such as gradual replacement uploading, but not others, such as scan-and-copy uploading. Is selective optimism about uploading a rational stance? In this paper I argue that the answer is yes. The paper has a negative and a positive part. First, I defuse an objection against\n selective optimism from Wiley and Koene (2016). Wiley and Koene argue that gradual replacement uploading is metaphysically equivalent to scanand-copy uploading, and hence optimism about the former and pessimism about the latter is unfounded. I show that Wiley and Koene's case for the supposed\n metaphysical equivalence fails, since there is a significant metaphysical contrast between the two types of uploading involving immanent causation. In the second part of the paper, I present a positive case for selective optimism about gradual uploading building on this contrast in immanent\n causation.",

These two positions tend to be confused, but we contend that a distinction can and should be made between the two approaches. To perform this explanation, we propose two axes of differentiation: the concept of enhancement itself and the valuation of the biological body. In this context, H+ begins with a disregard for the body and seeks to transcend the human condition with exponential enhancements, while HE advocates a gradual enhancement within our current limits. Clarifying this contrast between H+ and HE is vital for the responsible adoption of future technologies, enabling informed decisions about which scientific promises are viable and worthy of support, and which should be reconsidered.",

Al contrario, al trasplantar la mente a un cuerpo artificial se abre la posibilidad de la descentralización de la identidad, pues se consigue mezclar diferentes identidades que provienen de un mismo cerebro. Para esto, me baso en la androide Bina48. En el segundo apartado, exploro la descentralización de la identidad a partir de la voz autobiográfica de los órganos artificiales del híbrido cibernético, basada en los argumentos expuestos en Natural-Born Cyborgs de Andy Clark.

The main competing accounts of personal ontology hold that we are either souls (or composites of soul and body), or we are composite physical objects of some sort, but, as Brenner shows, arguments for either of these options can be parodied and transformed into their opposites. Brenner also examines arguments for and against the existence of the self, offers a detailed discussion of the metaphysics of several afterlife scenarios - resurrection, reincarnation, and mind uploading -- and considers whether agnosticism with respect to personal ontology should lead us to agnosticism with respect to the possibility of life after death.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n               AI and robotic technologies are reshaping embodied experience, specifically experiences of the relation of mind to body as well as experiences of “reality,” which necessitate the qualifiers augmented or virtual. Such technologies have allowed people to infuse the expanding assortment of technological experiences with spiritual meaning, thus expanding the ambit of spirituality and religiosity; at the same time, the technology has provided many researchers with occasion to argue that all spiritual and virtual experience—including of soul and deities—may only just ever be in the brain, putting the virtual back into the body but not without changing each. We are comparing three sites—VR, gaming, and transhuman mind uploading in Europe, the US, and Japan—not as sites of confusion but of “ontological opportunity,” that is, occasions for remaking experiences of embodiment and disembodiment, and changing the relation between reality and virtuality.",

    "title": "A free mind cannot be digitally transferred",
    "abstract": "AbstractThe digital transfer of the mind to a computer system (i.e., mind uploading) requires representing the mind as a finite sequence of bits (1s and 0s). The classic “stored-program computer” paradigm, in turn, implies the equivalence between program and data, so that the sequence of bits themselves can be interpreted as a program, which will be algorithmically executed in the receiving device. Now, according to a previous proof, on which this paper is based, a computational or algorithmic machine, however complex, cannot be free (in the sense of ‘self-determined’). Consequently, a finite sequence of bits cannot adequately represent a free mind and, therefore, a free mind cannot be digitally transferred, quod erat demonstrandum. The impossibility of making this transfer, as demonstrated here, should be a concern especially for those who wish to achieve it. Since we intend this to be a rigorous demonstration, we must give precise definitions and conditions of validity. The most important part of the paper is devoted to explaining the meaning and reasonableness of these definitions and conditions (for example that being truly free means being self-determined). Special attention is paid, also, to the philosophical implications of the demonstration. Finally, this thesis is distinguished from other closely related issues (such as other possible technological difficulties to “discretize” the mind; or, whether it is possible to transfer the mind from one material support to another one in a non-digital way).",

    "title": "Upload, Cyber-Spirituality and the Quest for Immortality in Contemporary Science-Fiction Film and Television",
    "abstract": "As a genre, science fiction has long played with the idea of all-powerful virtual beings and explored notions of transcendence through technological advancements. It has also been at the forefront of exploring our anxieties and hopes regarding new technologies and the ethical and moral consequences of scientific advancement, raising deeply philosophical and theological concerns about an age-old question, namely: what makes us distinct as human beings and what lies beyond our own existence? This article aims to provide an overview of recent themes that have emerged in science fiction film and television, especially with regard to extending our lives beyond their natural biological age. As the article will outline, these ideas generally appear in notions of cyborgization or mind uploading into cyberspace. Both indicate a deeply human desire to avoid death, and the films and shows discussed in this article offer a range of different ideas on this. As we will see, the final case study, the Amazon Prime television show Upload (2020–), brings both of these elements together, touching on a broad range of ideas about cyber-spirituality along the way. The article concludes that although many shows raise interesting questions about the ethical challenges inherent in transhumanist fantasies of mind uploading, they ultimately remain ambiguous in their critique of the dream of digital immortality.",

With the methodological support of recent studies on trans-/posthumanism and material/trans-corporeal feminism(s), this article will attempt to show how, by revindicating monstrosity as the legitimization of new forms of life and love, Winterson hybridizes trans- and posthumanist polarities and relativizes the rigidity of the debate around the de- and rematerialization of nature in the face of practices such as mind uploading, the mass production of sex robots, and enhancing biotechnologies, through a technocritical examination of the risks and possibilities of the com-posting of human and nonhuman matter.",

This article argues that the transhumanist ontology of information exhibits gnostic and docetic religious overtones in it and that it devalues physical existence. At the same time, despite claiming a rejection of supernature, hypothetical transhumanist practices (such as mind‐uploading) posit the infosphere as a kind of supernatural realm that is often set in opposition to the natural world.

The salience of transhumanism for Harry Potter is seen through the way that magic functions as an analogue to technology, and through the centrality of death throughout the series. Transhumanists pursue radical superlongevity by three pathways: bioengineering, cyborg engineering, and mind uploading. Each of these pathways, when applied heuristically to the magical pursuit of immortality in Harry Potter, receives explicit rejection in the text alongside the commendation of Harry’s non-pursuit of it. By way of analogy, Harry Potter’s perspective on death and immortality, which is informed in part by the Christian tradition, offers readers a critique of certain transhumanist aims along the lines of other ethical and religious analyses of the movement, and speaks to the deep desires and longings lying at their heart.",

He is recognized as one of the leading representatives of Russian postmodernism. Pelevin is also known as an attentive and critical observer of the surrounding reality. He is sometimes described as a deep thinker, a prophet, and a visionary. Pelevin’s literary work entitled Transhumanism Inc. (2021) is the subject of the analysis in this paper. The purpose of the article is to show and discuss Pelevin’s transhumanist vision of the future in which an isolated brain (removed from its host) will be able to survive indefinitely in a specialized container (‘a jar’) and human consciousness will exist within a virtual reality. However, access to this ‘jar dimension’ will be exclusive, limited only to the wealthy, leaders, and world oligarchs. However, it is the vampires, as supernatural creatures, who will be the real architects of the world order. This paper focuses on the analysis of the selected aspects of Pelevin’s literary work − mainly those which can be viewed in connection with the assumptions of the transhumanist project. Special attention is paid to the idea of cyber immortality, the concept of morphological freedom, and mind uploading.",

    "abstract": "Literature wields a profound influence on our cognitive processes, shaping not only how we think but also what we think about. Aesthetic experiences, in particular, seem to foster a positive impact on our ability to comprehend complexity. This influence underscores the significant role of literature in the exploration of value learning and ethics research, because evaluating any decision-making requires seeking the widest possible frame of reference. Furthermore, literature plays a pivotal role in enriching our perception of both the external world and our inner selves, thereby fostering a heightened sense of ethical discernment. In this paper, I explore this last idea by examining Kazuo Ishiguro'sKlara and the Sun. In this enquiry, I reveal connections between two crucial controversies surrounding mind uploading: the epistemological debate centered on the theory of moral perception and the ontological inquiry into personal identity. Researching the intersection of these two big issues guide my decision to employ conceptual synthesis as the methodological framework. Besides, I will argue that the ideas of moral perception and personal identity that emerges in Ishiguro's dystopia are in tune with the narrativist hypothesis of Charles Taylor. In my conclusions, I defend that prospect of replacing a human being with a robot hinges on the challenge of instilling the machine with a unique moral perception. This remains an elusive goal, perhaps perpetually so, due to the inherent impossibility of objectifying a machine capable of apprehending and processing the non-objective qualities of matter. Furthermore, even if we were able to create such a machine, it would likely resist assuming a substitutive role, as it would quickly discover and appreciate its own existence. Finally, I ponder the implications of mistaking a simulation of human for an authentic replica, namely, an unsuccessful and unnoticed attempt at mind uploading—loneliness.",

Doede explains how it is that contemporary scientists, philosophers, and intelligent laypersons find it easy, indeed almost natural, to take seriously that they are beings whose living identities are capable of being captured as digital software patterns, thereby decoupled from their vital bodies, and then uploaded onto a non-biodegradable substrate where they can carry on their lives in perpetuity; and why such a vision is, despite its mechanistic grammar, one fundamentally characterized as a striving for the re-enchantment of the world.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n               In this chapter, Thomas Fuchs argues, from a psychiatrist’s perspective and against the intrinsically mind-body-dualistic understanding of human beings advocated by transhumanists, that processes of life and processes of consciousness are inseparably linked through the living body as a whole. In the unity of the person, both aspects are intertwined: the body is alive and therefore also mindful; the mind is alive and therefore also truly embodied. Fuchs also demonstrates the importance of embodied cognition for psychiatry. This medical discipline is increasingly dominated by brain-centered research that focuses on drug treatment, deep-brain stimulation, and neuroenhancement designed only to change the person’s psyche. Fuchs argues that such an approach neglects both the embodied and relational structure of the human mind and risks rendering the patient dependent on mere technical support. Durable therapeutic changes can only be achieved through personal, i.e., embodied and interactive experiences—and these over time also influence the neuronal substrate through a circular interaction of ‘process’ and ‘structure.’",

    "abstract": "Mind upload, or the digital copying of an individual brain and mind, could theoretically allow one to “live forever.” If such a technology became available, who would be most likely to approve of it or condemn it? Research has shown that fear of death positively predicts the moral approval of hypothetical mind upload technology, while religiosity may have the opposite effect. We build on these findings, drawing also from work on religiosity and existential mattering as predictors of perceived meaning in one’s life. In a cross-sectional study (N = 1,007), we show that existential mattering and afterlife beliefs are negatively associated with moral approval of mind upload technology: people who believe there is a soul or some form of afterlife and who also report a high level of existential mattering, are least likely to morally approve of mind upload technology. Indeed, mind uploading—if it ever becomes feasible—is a form of technology that would fundamentally redraw the existential boundaries of what it means to be human.",

Taking as their starting point the aforementioned underrepresentation of women in the AI industry, they outline why cultural representations of AI scientists matter, before explaining the findings of their large quantitative study of a corpus of 142 influential films (1920–2020) containing AI. They discuss the key tropes that emerged from these films, before focusing on four key themes that are distinctly gendered and may contribute to the underrepresentation of women in the AI industry: first, the AI scientist as a ‘genius’; second, the AI scientist’s ability to gain mastery over life and death through the pursuit of ‘mind uploading’ and other forms of technological immortality; third, the association of AI with hypermasculine milieus, such as the military; and finally, the portrayal of female AI scientists as subservient or inferior to male AI scientists.",

    "abstract": "This research aims to delve into the intricate and multilayered connection between humans and posthumans, as depicted in Hannu Rajaniemi's Jean le Flambeur trilogy. This Finnish American author's trilogy, consisting of The Quantum Thief (2010), The Fractal Prince (2012), and The Causal Angel (2014), paints an insightful picture of this interaction. The investigation aims to illuminate the emergence of humanity in an extremely posthuman and postsingular landscape, arguing that one must understand humanity as not entirely separate from posthumanism. Instead, humanity should be considered a specific case, or limit case, of the broader posthumanist concept. The form of humanity that arises from the boundaries of an extreme posthuman state of evolution will not mirror the pre-posthuman state; instead, it will transform into a more comprehensive, inclusive entity. The analysis of these three novels will illustrate how Rajaniemi's work does not entirely dismiss human agency. Instead, it recontextualizes and reshapes it within a dramatically different posthuman setting.",

    "abstract": "AbstractOne possible way to decolonize the posthuman field of literary criticism is to find possible stylistic and thematic affinities between the literatures from the less technologically advanced regions such as South Asia and mainstream Euro-American science fiction. This article invites and affirms alternative ways of perceiving and comprehending the transhumanist posthuman paradigms from the technologically underdeveloped world (South Asia) through a critically informed analysis of the motifs, symbols, and characters in the Pakistani writer Uzma Aslam Khan’s Anglophone novel Trespassing (2003). It argues that the nonhuman agency of truck art in Trespassing can be interpreted as a metaphor for a possible local technique for consciousness uploading. By applying the theoretical framework of transhumanist/posthumanist literary theory, this article demonstrates that the depiction of truck art in the novel can be analyzed as an analogy for the transhumanist posthuman dream of whole brain emulation.",

Kurzweil indique également que cette conception de la vie « immortelle » en passe par un traitement du corps particulier, qu’il s’agit de surveiller et de traiter pour, in fine , espérer s’en passer («  mind uploading  »).

    "abstract": "In recent years and, in light of the latest developments in the field of neurotechnology, some critics have claimed that mind uploading could become technically feasible in a not-too-distant future. While transhumanist critics embrace this procedure and dream of a postbiological future in which human beings possess greater cognitive, emotional, and sensorial abilities, the critical posthumanists warn of the risks inherent to the idea of leaving biology behind to lead a virtual life in cyberspace. Significantly, these warnings reverberate in some twenty-first century cultural productions such as Mark McClelland’s Upload (2012), a novel that is also representative of an emerging trend of SF novels written by tech professionals. Although the novel may seem to be at first a defense of simulated life, this work aims to prove that McClelland’s narrative choices ultimately uncover a critical posthumanist view of embodiment as an essential part of human identity.",

Despite these formal advantages of the concept, this paper points to a number of arguments against its validity. These arguments revolve around two issues. One is to point out that while the concept of saving the Homo sapiens species is noble and should be supported, the way of saving humanity envisioned by the ESC departs from what should be understood by the concept of saving humanity through space colonization. The second issue is to draw attention to the ethical controversies that make this concept perhaps unsuitable for implementation at all. At least some of these objections do not address the concept of saving humanity by sending adult living persons on space missions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThis chapter examines the history of human-machine assemblages used to speak for the dead, comparing the practices of the nineteenth-century American Spiritualist movement with those of present-day transhumanist mind-uploading. In both cases, forms of mediated communication give the dead a continuing voice in society through a participatory performance involving the medium—a person whose consciousness is suspended in a state of trance, or a set of algorithms—the deceased, and an audience. Mediumship becomes a theater in which audiences both desire and interrogate the capabilities of necro-communication technology. The chapter attends to these technologies’ implied models of selfhood, which disaggregate mental content—software—from the vehicle of its expression—hardware—in the tradition of Cartesian dualism. The chapter argues that the technologies in question inevitably structure, in concerning ways, political notions of possessive individualism, which become commoditized in the shift from human-performed mediumship to selfhood instantiated in proprietary software products.",

    "abstract": "Nos proponemos en este artículo analizar dos obras recientes que tienen como tema común la utopía de la inmortalidad alcanzada a través de los medios tecnólogicos, esto es, la mind uploading, la “subida”: el cuento del mexicano Alberto Chimal “La segunda Celeste”, incluido en Manos de lumbre (2018), y la novela escrita en forma de crónica Sinfín (2020) del argentino Martín Caparrós. Nuestro objetivo es demostrar que las dos obras tratan el tema de la “subida” como una utopía en el sentido dado a este término por Matthew Beaumont, es decir, una mirada sobre un presente historizado desde la perspectiva de un futuro fantástico, y reflejan más bien las contradicciones de la presente visión sobre lo humano que una cala real en un futuro implacablemente opaco. Al mismo tiempo, mostraremos que en las dos obras se transparenta la paradoja observada por Fredic Jameson respecto a la imposibilidad de distinguir entre la utopía y la distopía en el momento en que se trata de indagar el futuro. Por fin, intentaremos poner de relieve que, en los dos textos, la utópica “subida”, que es uno de los objetivos fundamentales de la agenda transhumanista, se contempla con el escepticismo derivado de una visión pesimista sobre un sujeto que accede a la tecnología sin ser capaz de superar sus debilidades humanas, por lo cual, fracasa en su intento de convertirse en “post-humano”.",

The question is whether all these ideas will be realized. The purpose of the article is to show that not all transhumanist aspirations can be put into practice. The first reason is that transhumanism limits human’s understanding to the material dimension (from a theological point of view). While this is understandable in the naturalistic paradigm, this approach is insufficient when it comes to all complexity of human being and for this reason tanshumanism represents too narrow a human’s understanding to be able to implement its all assumptions. The second reason is that to enable people to become posthumans the latest technologies would have to be available to everyone and this seems impossible. If so, such a situation will divide people into ordinary people and posthumans and this could lead to conflicts that transhumanists want to avoid after all. Finally, the body-mind problem is essentially limited to emergentism, which corresponds to the naturalistic paradigm. It seems, however, that without the concept of the soul it is impossible to understand who a man is, his/her identity and consciousness and this is crucial for mind uploading.",

    "title": "POSTHUMAN TRANSFORMATION IN ANCIENT MEDITERRANEAN THOUGHT: BECOMING ANGELS AND DEMONS",
    "abstract": "There is not just a desire but a profound human need for enhancement - the irrepressible yearning to become better than ourselves. Today, enhancement is often conceived of in terms of biotechnical intervention: genetic modification, prostheses, implants, drug therapy - even mind uploading. The theme of this book is an ancient form of enhancement: a physical upgrade that involves ethical practices of self-realization. It has been called 'angelification' - a transformation by which people become angels. The parallel process is 'daimonification', or becoming daimones. Ranging in time from Hesiod and Empedocles through Plato and Origen to Plotinus and Christian gnostics, this book explores not only how these two forms of posthuman transformation are related, but also how they connect and chasten modern visions of transhumanist enhancement which generally lack a robust account of moral improvement.",

    "abstract": "Hierdie artikel stel ondersoek in na die wyses waarop die konsep van utopie en/of die utopiese met 'n Deleuziaanse konsep van wording en/of anderswording in verband gebring kan word. Aangesien 'n tematisering van utopie, of alternatiewelik 'n problematisering van hierdie begrip, dikwels in die wetenskapsfiksie-genre vergestalt word, word vir die doeleindes van dié ondersoek die wetenskapsfiksie-trilogie van regisseur Neill Blomkamp bespreek. Op verhaalvlak is daar in District 9, Elysium en Chappie telkens voorbeelde van wording of anderswording, wat elk in terme van 'n utopiese horison geïnterpreteer kan word. Hoewel die protagonis van District 9 anders word, is die utopie waarop Wikus wag 'n terugskouende en statiese restourasie van die verlede. En hoewel Max in Elysium betreklik min verander, realiseer hy deur middel van sy lewensoffer 'n oënskynlike utopie vir almal, wat by nabetragting egter insgelyks 'n statiese opvatting van utopie verraai - 'n wêreld wat die distopiese saad reeds in sy kern dra. Chappie skyn die enigste film van die trilogie te wees om Deleuze se idee van wording met utopie as die dinamiese utopiese in verband te bring.",

    "abstract": "Elon Musk regularly advertises for the simulation argument, stressing that he regards it as highly likely that we live in a computer simulation. However, it must be noted that the argument can be reconstructed such that its line of thought can be rationally grasped. This, however, does not necessarily mean that it is a plausible argument. The argument presupposes the anthropology that human beings can be uploaded onto a hard drive, which is based upon the view that humans are nothing like a software running on our body which serves as our hardware. It is this understanding of the human species which has been employed by many transhumanists who stress that immortality is near. The author will explain the line of thought underlining the simulation argument while they will, at the same time, explain that it is neither highly likely that we live in a computer simulation, nor that we can upload our personalities onto a computer, and even if this was possible, it would not enable us to become immortal.",

New terminologies and latest projects such as genome editing, mind uploading and tissue engineering applications for the growth of new organs are issues of discussion in this paper.Methods:Several advanced biotechnological methods are presented in this paper, including the 14-days rule, the 2045 Initiative project and the CRISPR technique and their social and ethical implications are discussed.Results:The exponential aging of the population results in rapidly increasing demands for next-generation drugs and innovative pharmaceutical products that target individualized genetic treatment, resulting in the emergence of controversial ethical and social implications in the forthcoming post-Homo sapiens Era.Conclusion:The next-generation ethics must be clarified, an interdisciplinary debate should be initiated, and all the different perspectives must be recorded and evaluated to adopt the most efficient practices for controversial topics like the potential digital immortality.",

    "abstract": "Transhumanism is one of the main “ideologies of the future” that has emerged in recent decades. Its program for the enhancement of the human species during this century pursues the ultimate goal of immortality, through the creation of human brain emulations. Therefore, transhumanism offers its fol- lowers an explicit eschatology, a vision of the ultimate future of our civilization that in some cases coincides with the ultimate future of the universe, as in Frank Tipler’s Omega Point theory. The essay aims to analyze the points of comparison and opposition between transhumanist and Christian eschatologies, in particular considering the “incarnationist” view of Parousia. After an introduction concern- ing the problems posed by new scientific and cosmological theories to traditional Christian eschatology, causing the debate between “incarnationists” and “escha- tologists,” the article analyzes the transhumanist idea of mind-uploading through the possibility of making emulations of the human brain and perfect simulations of the reality we live in. In the last section the problems raised by these theories are analyzed from the point of Christian theology, in particular the proposal of a transhuman species through the emulation of the body and mind of human beings. The possibility of a transhumanist eschatology in line with the incarnationist view of Parousia is refused.",

    "abstract": "One of the more radical transhumanist proposals for future human being envisions the uploading of our minds to a digital substrate, trading our dependence on frail, degenerating “meat” bodies for the immortality of software existence. Yet metaphor studies indicate that our use of metaphor operates in our bodily inhabiting of the world, and a phenomenological approach emphasizes a “hybridity” to human being that resists traditional mind/body dichotomies. Future scenarios envisioning mind uploading and disembodied artificial intelligence (AI) share an apocalyptic category with more traditional religious eschatologies, though they differ markedly in content; therefore, the insights of embodied cognition and their uptake in technological innovation are considered as they apply to theological concerns. Theology often functions in debates over the technological future to critique or to caution. However, theologians may learn from their technological dialogue partners when it comes to the future of embodiment and its implications for the construction and practice of theology.",

Two examples will be considered. First, the optimism observed at a transhumanist event will be examined to emphasize the positive affective aspects of certain apocalypse scenarios, especially those with an implicit eschatological direction. Second, an online location where examples of existential despair can be noted will be explored further to demonstrate the kinds of negative responses to certain superintelligence/singularity ideas.

    "abstract": "This article explores questions about chatbots in particular and artificial intelligence (AI) in general from a Pauline, that is, a Christian theological perspective. It does so in a way that focuses on a particular scene in the New Testament: Paul in the Athenian Areopagus, considering an altar to an “unknown God,” quoting Greek poets and philosophers, and sharing curious theology as he dialogues with Stoic and Epicurean thinkers (Acts 17:16–34). By examining the sociohistorical nuances of this scene and their philosophical and theological implications, this article shows how the altar Paul considers philosophically and theologically becomes the focal point for an important dialogue about apocalyptic ends, or ideas about who we are, where we are going, and who or what is responsible for that who‐ness and where‐ness. In turn, this can teach us how to ask practical questions, which can uncover the unsuspected apocalyptic ends represented by, or even contained within, common technological objects such as chatbots.",

    "abstract": "In this article, I present a critique of Robert Geraci's Apocalyptic artificial intelligence (AI) discourse, drawing attention to certain shortcomings which become apparent when the analytical lens shifts from religion to the race–religion nexus. Building on earlier work, I explore the phenomenon of existential risk associated with Apocalyptic AI in relation to “White Crisis,” a modern racial phenomenon with premodern religious origins. Adopting a critical race theoretical and decolonial perspective, I argue that all three phenomena are entangled and they should be understood as a strategy, albeit perhaps merely rhetorical, for maintaining white hegemony under nonwhite contestation. I further suggest that this claim can be shown to be supported by the disclosure of continuity through change in the long‐durée entanglement of race and religion associated with the establishment, maintenance, expansion, and refinement of the modern/colonial world system if and when such phenomena are understood as iterative shifts in a programmatic trajectory of domination which might usefully be framed as “algorithmic racism.”",

    "title": "Robot clones—New perspectives in robophilosophy and technoimmortality",
    "abstract": "The problem of total mind uploading (and consciousness) is far from fully solved at present within both the scientific and philosophical paradigms. At the same time, the hypothesis that a robot clone would represent a substitute of one's own person (based on the mindclone argument) questions not only the future ontological status of robot clones (in society) but also its possible personhood quality, in a process whose result is the overthrow of anthropocentrism, seen as the fundamental ideological definition of human nature. Thus, this research is aimed at analyzing technoimmortality in the robot clones paradigm, starting from the theories of Martine Rothblatt and Ray Kurzweil regarding mind uploading in cyberconsciousness and robot clones theory. The overall objective of this paper is to analyze the hypothesis of robot clones' personhood quality, along with the ontological status issue, based on the arguments of Immanuel Kant, Lynne Rudder Baker, and John Searl. The theoretical objective follows to deconstruct the way in which mind cloning (consciousness theory) into a humanoid robot clone, supported by the arguments of Martine Rothblatt, Ray Kurzweil, and Daniel Dennett, actually leads to a simulacrum of our own person&amp;mdash;namely a philosophical zombie&amp;mdash;according to the theories put forth by Ned Block, David Chalmers, and Searl. The methodology used is that of Rothblatt, Dennett, and Kurzweil's functional argumentation, alongside Block, Searl, and Chalmers's critique of the artificial consciousness of robot clones, completed by Kantian's argumentative critique of robot clone personhood.",

    "abstract": "Eighty years ago, Nicholas Berdyaev cautioned that new technological problems needed to be addressed with a new philosophical anthropology. Today, the transhumanist goal of mind uploading is perceived by many theologians and philosophers to be dangerous due to its violation of the human person. I contrast transhumanist “patternist” views of the person with Brent Waters’s Augustinian view of the technological pilgrim, Celia Deane-Drummond’s evolutionary Thomistic view of humanity, and Francis Fukuyama’s insistence on the inviolability of “Factor X”. These latter three thinkers all disagree with the patternist position, but their views are also discordant with each other. This disagreement constitutes a challenge for people of faith confronting transhumanism—which view is to be taken right? I contend that Science, Technology and Society (STS) studies can enrich our understanding of the debates by highlighting the transmutation of philosophical view into scientific theory and the intermingled nature of our forms of knowledge. Furthermore, I contend that STS helps Christians understand the evolution of their own anthropologies and suggests some prospects for future theological anthropology.",
